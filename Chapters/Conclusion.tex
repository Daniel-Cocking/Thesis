\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{section:Conclusion}

In this thesis \ac{MRI} and \ac{MRSI} tuned to the $^2$H resonance at 3T and 7T has been used to explore some of the important MR parameters such as T$_1$ relaxation times as well as the metabolic behaviour of $^2$H glucose \textit{in vivo} using \ac{DMI}. Due to this work not being performed on human scanners \textit{in vivo} at the \ac{SPMIC} previously, some of the hardware used such as \ac{RF} coils where in-house built and the details of choosing the type of coil and the building of the coil are described here as well. $^2$H MRSI with $^2$H glucose is regularly used to investigate metabolic diseases such as brain tumours due to increased \ac{CNR} from metabolite concentration maps. The aim of this work is to have successfully laid the groundwork for future studies to investigate brain tumours in patients \textit{in vivo} using \ac{DMI} at 7T, at writing ethics have been approved for patient studies. 

\section{Chapter Overviews}

To obtain a complete understanding of this relatively new technique (\ac{DMI}) it is important to establish an initial understanding of the background and history of the technique which is described in Chapter \ref{Chap:Introduction}. The basic biology behind metabolism and the pathways that an ingested $^2$H will take through the body can be found here. The historic use of $^2$H in MR research is described in this chapter from its discovery, to its use in heavy water in the 1980's in animal models, to its current most popular use as $^2$H glucose.

The physics that underpins the development of the experimental work in this Thesis is outlined in Chapter \ref{Chap:Theory}. Initially describing how \ac{NMR} data is obtained going from a microscopic to a macroscopic picture and the use of large electromagnetic gradients. Most of \ac{MRI} and \ac{MRS} research is performed by tuning to the Universe's most abundant element $^1$H, therefore the differences when tuning to a quadrupolar nuclei such as $^2$H is explained here. \Ac{MRSI} techniques are used in numerously throughout this thesis so the acquisition of this type of data is explained here and the options of different scans that can be used to obtain this data are explained. The mathematical approach to analysing $^2$H spectra is shown in this chapter as well as the strategies to improve the intricate low \ac{SNR}. Finally the theory behind building \ac{RF} coils is shown here along with details on the electrical components.

To accurately design and optimise scanning protocols it is important to have intimate details on all the physical properties that make up the compound being scanned, one of the most important is the T$_1$ relaxation time which helps decide on the \ac{TR} and the flip angle used. The T$_1$ times for \textit{in vivo} deuterated water in \ac{CSF}, \ac{GM} and \ac{WM} are found in this chapter to increase the accuracy in later concentration quantification and improve future protocol design. Participants that were undertaking a study into cell proteomics were ingesting heavy water, a collaboration was formed with this study which allowed \ac{MEGE} images with a range of \ac{TR}'s to be obtained such that an \ac{IR} analysis is performed. Two of the participants were also scanned when they first began ingesting heavy water at regular intervals so that the time course of the increase in $^2$H levels is explored.

Before any work on patients can be undertaken it is important initial studies that involve healthy human participants are performed, this is so that scanning protocols can be optimised for comfortability and reduce the needed scan time which is performed in Chapter \ref{Chap:Glucose}. Therefore, healthy participants were given D$_2$- and D$_7$ glucose and concentration maps were obtained for \ac{HDO}, glucose, Glx and lactate. The change against time is shown, and it is found there is considerable gain in \ac{SNR} when using D$_7$-glucose versus D$_2$-glucose for each metabolite which would potentially result in increased \ac{CNR} for healthy tissue against diseased tissue.

The metabolism of lipids can provide useful insights for diabetes, currently one of the most popular methods obtain data to investigate this involves performing invasive biopsied. Chapter \ref{Chap:Lipid} shows the first results using $^2$H tuned MRSI to investigate increased lipid signals following ingestion of D$_2$O, increases in two out of three participants in the abdomen and in 1 out of 3 in the calf. T$_1$ relaxation times were also found at natural abundance of \ac{HDO} and deuterated lipid in skeletal muscle were also found in this chapter.

One of the different characteristics of $^2$H compared to $^1$H is the quadrupolar relaxation which causes spectral broadening/splitting that depends on the anisotropy of the muscle. The magnitude of splitting in both the forearm and the calf was quantified in different muscle groups (where possible) in Chapter \ref{Chap:Quad} along with the relationship between the \ac{DQF} signal and splitting magnitude and finally the evolution of \ac{DQF} with varying creation time ($\tau$). This was made possible due to the increased \ac{SNR} obtained from participants ingesting D$_2$O. This is the first time this has been attempted using $^2$H resonance in humans \textit{in vivo}. 

\section{Future Directions}

A common tool throughout the whole thesis is the use of some instrument of de-noising. Whilst apodisation/line-broadening has already been shown to be useful at increasing \ac{SNR} it is problematic with $^2$H spectra as quite commonly spectral lineshapes can overlap, it can also negatively impact quantification. To overcome this \ac{HOSVD} is used throughout this thesis with matrices up to 4-dimensions and has shown to be pivotal in improving fitting accuracy through increased \ac{SNR}. There is a current trend in the field currently whereby this strategy is implemented with the level of den-noising used as similar to other works etc. It would be great to see more of a focus on \ac{HOSVD} as a de-noising tool (as oppose to just a data reduction tool) and how far this method can be pushed without sacrificing spatial/temporal/spectral information. One of the ways in which spectral fitting was improved was through the addition of prior knowledge, it would be great to see the same thought process applied to de-noising for example does data/matrix shape effect de-noising?

It is important to note that whilst this thesis is a great example of how to obtain and analyse \textit{in vivo} $^2$H data, this work only sets the foundation. As has been pointed out there are current issues with how metabolic information is obtained clinically, using \ac{PET}, $^2$H has the potential to obtain similar information. However, this first has to be shown in patient studies as the usefulness of this technique can not truly be understand until direct comparisons are made with current clinical work. Whilst $^2$H glucose and Glx are important metabolites in the investigation of brain tumours, arguably one of the most important is lactate. Currently it is difficult to optimise a scan for imaging lactate as signal levels do not reach far above natural abundance in healthy participants, brain tumours cause a significant increase in lactate produced which can be detected using $^2$H. Also, patients potentially will not be able to stay in the scanner as long so the total scan time has to be reduced, which means it can be difficult to obtain as much useful information. Therefore, it would be great to see this technique not only used in brain tumour patients but also in other metabolic diseases such as \ac{AD} or \ac{PD}.

One of the difficulties when trying to track $^2$H incorporation into lipids after D$_2$O ingestion is the overlap of signals. When only one peak in a spectra can be visualised it means that when an image is obtained of the same data it can also directly inform on the peak in the spectra. Therefore if the increased \ac{HDO} signal was able to be nulled only the lipid would be visible, therefore if the same sequence was used to acquire image data a greater \ac{SNR} could potentially be obtained. However, for this to be possible almost near perfect water suppression be needed which can be difficult to achieve. In the \ac{DQF} spectra the data suffers from low \ac{SNR} as well and only has one signal present, therefore this sequence could be made into an imaging sequence which could potentially result in smaller voxels which would hopefully reduce effects from partial voluming creating multiple separations in the same voxel. Therefore in the future it would be great to see more applications of $^2$H imaging as oppose to spectroscopy for more sparse spectra situations, it's important to note this wouldn't be possible for \ac{DMI} experiments due to the multiple metabolite peaks being present.

\section{Closing Remarks}

In this thesis it has been shown not only possible to obtain \textit{in vivo} $^2$H spectroscopic information in a reasonable time frame, in humans, as well as $^2$H \ac{MRI} and \ac{MRSI}. Whilst the current most popular use for $^2$H in MR research is in \ac{DMI}, this thesis has shown the wide potential of uses for $^2$H and why this nuclei is becoming more popular. I hope this thesis helps push clinical strategies away from either ionising and/or invasive procedures and helps open up a pathway to more $^2$H MR research and into a place where $^2$H capabilities comes as standard in all clinical scanners.
