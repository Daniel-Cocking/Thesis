\section{Introduction}

Adipose tissue (more commonly known as body fat) is key for energy storage and can be found either under the skin (subcutaneous fat) or around internal organs (visceral fat) as well as in bone marrow, in breast tissue and around muscles. The cells that make up this tissue are known as adipocytes. They store energy as \ac{TG}, and the breakdown/turnover of adipocytes and \ac{TG} is thought to be a good indicator of metabolic health and homeostasis. Adipose tissue growth is possible through enlargement of existing adipocytes (hypertrophy) as well as by increases in pre-adipocyte and adipocyte numbers (hyperplasia). Adipocyte death is also a vital part of the \ac{TG} turnover \cite{White2019DynamicsDisease}. The differences between these processes in adipose tissue provides vital information on metabolic health \cite{Carnethon2002Serum19871998}. It was originally thought that increases in adipocyte count only occur during childhood and adolescence \cite{Salans1973StudiesPatients}, and that changes in weight in adulthood are due to adipocyte size changes. However, new studies now show this is not the case \cite{White2016DifferencesWomen}, indicating the importance of \textit{in vivo} studies into adipose tissue turnover.

\textit{In vitro} methods using cell cultures can be used to assess adipose/lipid turnover and can provide information about specific adipocyte growth and death \cite{Tchkonia2002FatPreadipocytes}. However, results from cell culture experiments do not necessarily provide insight into the turnover of lipids in tissue in the human body. One of the reasons for using \textit{in vitro} methodology is that the half-life of \ac{TG} \textit{in vivo} in humans has been found to be $\sim$six months \cite{Strawford2004AdiposeO}, which can make it difficult to measure. However, lipid turnover can be measured by using $^2$H labelling through \ac{D$_2$O} ingestion and invasive tissue sampling (biopsy), with the analysis being performed using mass spectrometry and application of \ac{MIDA} \cite{White2019DynamicsDisease, Strawford2004AdiposeO, Belew2022DeTracers, Turner2003MeasurementMIDA}. Following heavy water loading, $^2$H makes its way into the glycerol moiety and fatty acid chains of triglycerides during lipid formation (lipogenesis) making it possible to measure TG synthesis \cite{Turner2003MeasurementMIDA}. Using this method differences in the \ac{TG} synthesis rate between healthy and insulin-resistant individuals \cite{Allister2015InHumans} and between different races \cite{White2018RacialHumans} have been evaluated. However, the need for biopsy restricts the range of tissue sites that can be sampled (e.g., making it difficult to sample visceral fat) and causes patient discomfort. Heavy water loading has previously been utilized in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (\ac{MRI}/\ac{MRS}) allowing \textit{in vivo} measurement of enhanced $^2$H MR signals from water in humans and from water and fat in animals \cite{Brereton1989TheMice, Cocking2023DeuteriumDosing}. The enrichment of $^2$H into \ac{HDO} that can be measured using \ac{MRI} or \ac{MRS} has been shown to follow physiological estimates and can therefore be accurately predicted \cite{Cocking2023DeuteriumDosing}. The enrichment into lipids measured using invasive techniques is much slower \cite{White2019DynamicsDisease, Strawford2004AdiposeO} but can also be predicted \cite{White2019DynamicsDisease}.

\section{Theory}
\label{Chap:Lip:Theory}

The $^2$H MR signal that arises from naturally occurring \ac{HDO} \textit{in vivo} is $\sim$0.015\% (NA). Water turnover in the body involves a balance between water loss through urinating, breathing and sweating and water replenishment through what we eat and drink. The amount of water turning over each day can be written as $L$. As has already been shown it is possible to increase the \textit{in vivo} $^2$H abundance by ingesting extra $^2$H in the form of heavy water (or an aqueous solution of heavy water). The new $^2$H abundance in a day ($A_{t+1}$ as a percentage) can then be estimated using an iterative calculation, and is relative to a participants total body water (BW) volume as shown here

\begin{equation}
    A_{t+1} = A_t + \frac{L[\textrm{NA} - A_t]}{\textrm{BW}} + \frac{D}{\textrm{BW}}
    \label{eqn:Lip:HDO}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the abundance in the previous day is given as $A_t$, and the amount of $^2$H consumed in the day is $D$. This equation is useful when the extra $^2$H is ingested on a daily basis, the change in $^2$H abundance with respect to time ($dA/dt$) can then be calculated as a differential equation shown here

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{L[\textrm{NA} - A]}{\textrm{BW}} + \frac{D}{\textrm{BW}}
    \label{eqn:Lip:HDO_diff}
\end{equation}

\noindent It is noted that $L/$BW is the water turnover  relative to body weight which can be considered as a rate constant ($\lambda_w$). We can estimate $\lambda_w\sim 3/41$, assuming 3 L of fluid turnover and a typical BW of 41 L. It can be beneficial to look at the change in $^2$H abundance as a multiplicative change compared to NA ($E=A/$NA). The differential equation then becomes

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dE}{dt} = \lambda_w(1-E) + \frac{D}{\textrm{BW} \cdot \textrm{NA}}
    \label{eqn:Lip:HDO_diffE}
\end{equation}

\noindent Once the loading period ends ($D=0$), Eq. \ref{eqn:Lip:HDO_diffE} can be simply solved. Here the enrichment $E$ exponentially decays from $E_0$, the enrichment at the end of loading, to natural abundance ($E=1$ at $t=\infty$ and $E=E_0$ at $t=0$), with a time constant $\lambda_w$. The solution is shown empirically here

\begin{equation}
    E = (E_0 - 1)\exp(-\lambda_wt) + 1
    \label{eqn:Lip:E}
\end{equation}

\noindent To calculate the enhancement of $^2$H in water, accurate estimates for $L$ and BW are needed. It is difficult to accurately determine $L$ as it depends on an individual's lifestyle, however BW can be estimated from known formulae. Lines of best fits have been found that relate total body-water to anthropometric measurements (height ($H$), weight ($W$), age ($A$) and gender) \cite{Watson1980TotalMeasurements}, equations for the relationships are found here for males 

\begin{equation}
    \textrm{BW(litres)} = 2.447-0.09516A\textrm{(years)}+0.1074H\textrm{(cm)}+0.3362W\textrm({kg})
    \label{eqn:Lip:male}
\end{equation}

\noindent and for females here

\begin{equation}
    \textrm{BW(litres)} = -2.097+0.1069H\textrm{(cm)}+0.2466W\textrm({kg})
    \label{eqn:Lip:female}
\end{equation}

Data from lipid turnover studies looking at the $^{14}$C content of fat show that the rate of lipid storage is $\sim$16 kg/year (44g/day) \cite{Arner2011DynamicsDisease, Spalding2017ImpactTissue}, which gives a time constant ($t_f$) for lipid turnover of $\sim$397 days. This estimate assumes a healthy 70 kg individual with a body fat content of 25\%, but the value varies depending on the individual's weight, age and height. By making some assumptions about the incorporation of $^2$H from water into fat we can use the value of $t_f$ to estimate the concentration of $^2$H in fat during and after a period of heavy water loading. The enhancement of the $^2$H concentration in fat relative to natural abundance depends on the rate constant ($\lambda_f = 1/t_f$) the number of days of heavy water loading ($t$), the level of water enhancement ($E$) and the fraction ($f$) of H atoms incorporated into CH$_2$/CH$_3$ groups from water in newly formed fat. It has been found that $\sim$20\% of stored lipids arise from \ac{DNL}, compared to triglycerides recycled from fatty acid breakdown. In the case of triglyeride recycling H atoms in CH$_2$/CH$_3$ groups do not exchange with water but in the case of \ac{DNL} 1/3 of the H atoms in CH$_2$/CH$_3$ groups come from water, and 2/3 are derived from the metabolite NADPH \cite{Zhang2017ChemicalNADPH}. Conservatively the fraction ($f$) of H atoms in CH$_2$/CH$_3$ derived from water can therefore be approximated to a conservative value of 5\%. It is important to note that the H in NADPH can undergo catalytic exchange with water which can boost enhancement. If the water enhancement $E$ is approximated at $\times$100 for 28 days, and assuming a range of $f$ of 5-20\% this gives an enhancement of 35-140\%. This enhancement should theoretically be detectable using $^2$H MRS \textit{in vivo} \cite{Brereton1986PreliminarySpectroscopy}. 

Assuming the water $^2$H enhancement $E$ is constant and equal to $E_0$ the enhancement of $^2$H in lipids ($S$) after time $t$ can be estimated using the assumed values for $\lambda_f$ and $f$ and the following analytical expression

\begin{equation}
    S = 1 + f(E_0 - 1)(1 - \exp(-\lambda_ft)
    \label{eqn:Lip:Load}
\end{equation}

However, this is not usually the case as often the loading regime will often involve a changing concentration of $^2$H in water. For example, during rapid loading participants can experience periods of dizziness and nausea \cite{Money1974HeavyAlcohol}, and to mitigate this issue, the volume of heavy water consumed per day can be varied during the loading period \cite{Strawford2004AdiposeO, Cocking2023DeuteriumDosing}. Therefore, a more generalised differential equation (Eq. \ref{eqn:Lip:Diff}) is used to estimate the enhancement in fat, which is calculated iteratively and numerically using the temporally varying water enhancement $E(t)$. Now changes in the loading regime can be accounted for before and after the cessation of the loading period. Example loading regimes, \ac{HDO} enhancements and corresponding signal enhancements in lipids are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Lip:Load} according to

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dS}{dt} = \lambda_f(f(E(t)-1)+1-S)
    \label{eqn:Lip:Diff}
\end{equation}

 % the cessation of loading that changes the analytical form of $E$ in Eq. \ref{eqn:Lip:E} needs to be accounted for in $S$. This is done in Eq. \ref{eqn:Lip:Full} by introducing the time constant $\lambda_w$, where $S_0$ is the enhancement in fat achieved at the end of the loading period.

% \begin{equation}
%     S = (S_0 - 1)\exp(-\lambda_ft)+\frac{\lambda_f}{(\lambda_w - \lambda_f)}f(E_0 - 1)[\exp(-%     \lambda_ft)-\exp(-\lambda_wt)]
%     \label{eqn:Lip:Full}
% \end{equation}

Solutions of Eq. \ref{eqn:Lip:Diff} are used to predict the enhancement of lipid signal that should be detected using $^2$H \ac{MRI}/\ac{MRS}, leading to an estimated increase in fat signal of 30-40\%. This level of enhancement should be detectable and could therefore inform on metabolic health. 
 
As a precursor to tracer studies we explored the deuterium spectrum obtained from the lower leg at \ac{NA} in four healthy human participants, characterising the T$_1$ and T$_2^*$ relaxation times of the two spectral lines and demonstrating that measurements are feasible at 3T magnetic field strength on a clinical scanner using a transceive, surface \ac{RF} coil. We also evaluate whether $^2$H MR at 3T in conjunction with \ac{D$_2$O} loading could be used for non-invasive monitoring of lipid turnover in human subjects as an alternative to a methodology that uses \ac{D$_2$O} loading in conjunction with invasive biopsy. Three different healthy male participants were loaded for approximately four weeks and scanned weekly or fortnightly for approximately sixteen weeks using $^2$H \ac{CSI} imaging.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\ac{NA}}{NA} Scanning}

T$_1$ relaxation times of \ac{HDO} and lipid signals were measured \textit{in vivo} at 3T in the calf of in four different healthy human participants \cite{Damion2021NaturalT}. Scanning was performed on a 3T scanner (Philips Achieva) using an in-house built surface coil (5 cm diameter) tuned to the deuterium resonance 19.6 MHz. The surface coil was placed under the calf muscle of the left leg. Non-localised \ac{IR} spectra were acquired at \ac{NA}, using a 900 Hz bandwidth adiabatic hyperbolic secant inversion pulse followed by an inversion delay and then a non-selective \ac{RF} pulse of 90$^\circ$ nominal flip angle. Inversion times were $\tau$: {5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 1000} ms, for a fixed \ac{TR}: 1200 ms (time between adiabatic pulses). \ac{FID}s were collected with 512 samples, NSA: 128, \ac{BW}: 3000 Hz. FIDs were truncated, zero-filled to 512 points, and line-broadened using a 5 Hz exponential filter. % The pulse sequence used to obtain this data can be viewed in Fig. \ref{fig.pulse}. 

\begin{figure}

    \label{fig:Lip:Coil}
\end{figure}

The data was analysed using code written in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, USA). Spectra acquired with a surface coil over a large volume can show peaks with different phases due to the averaging of various \ac{RF} factors over spatial distributions which are different for the molecules producing the spectral peaks. Therefore, a global zeroth-order phase-correction cannot be applied. Instead, the complex spectra were fitted to a sum of two complex Lorentzian lineshape functions employing independent phases for each spectral peak, as well as independent values of amplitude, frequency, and R$_2^*$. The inappropriateness of a simple phase-correction and the fact that the phases are functions of inversion time (other than the usual phase-shift at the null-point) mean that the inversion-recovery curve also needs to be analysed as a complex function for each resonance as this allows phase to vary with $\tau$ and \ac{TR}. The complex equation used for fitting is shown here  

\begin{equation}
    M(\tau) = \alpha - \beta\exp(-\frac{\tau}{T_1}) + (\beta - \alpha)\exp(-\frac{T_R}{T_1})
    \label{eqn:Lip:IR}
\end{equation}

where $M(\tau)$ is the complex magnetization (determined by the spectral amplitude and phase) and $\tau$ is the inversion time, while $B$ and $\alpha$ are complex coefficients. The T$_2^*$ relaxation times for each peak were obtained from the fit of the Lorentzian and averaged over all inversion delays, the T$_1$ relaxation time was found from the fit of the \ac{IR} curve for each peak. Two peaks were consistently measured in all spectra. The chemical shift separation of these peaks was measured to be 3.55 $\pm$ 0.12 ppm. An example of the spectra that were acquired at different inversion times can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:Lip:IR}.

\subsubsection{Results}

    \label{fig:Lip:IR}
\end{figure}

The larger peak in Fig. \ref{fig:Lip:IR} corresponds to the HDO present in the calf, whilst the second, smaller peak originates from the CHD groups in adipose tissue (body fat). After correcting for applied line-broadening, mean T$_2^*$ values were obtained for \ac{HDO} of 8.2 $\pm$ 1.6 ms, and 14.0 $\pm$ 2.5 ms for lipids (n=4, see Table \ref{fig:Lip:R_Table}). Figure \ref{fig:Lip:IR} shows a set of spectra acquired during an \ac{IR} experiment. All spectra were globally shifted in reference to the spectrum of longest inversion time. Figure \ref{fig:Lip:Amp_Tau} shows the complex spectral amplitudes and the fits to Eq. \ref{eqn:Lip:IR}, for the two peaks (\ac{HDO} and lipids). Mean T$_1$ values were found to be 199 $\pm$ 34 ms for \ac{HDO} and 56 $\pm$ 10 ms for lipids (n=4, see Table \ref{fig:Lip:R_Table}).

\subsection{Fat Measurements by \texorpdfstring{D$_2$O}{D2O} Loading}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figures/Lipid/Loading_Routine.png}
    \caption{\textit{(A) Loading regimes followed by the three subjects (S1, S2 and S3): volume of 70\% D2O/30\% H$_2$O ingested per day. (B) Estimated signal enhancement in water signal relative to NA. (C) Estimated signal enhancement in fat relative to NA. These values were estimated using individual subject’s weight, height, and age, assuming 3.75 litre water turn-over per day, lipid half-life of 270 days \cite{Arner2011DynamicsDisease, Spalding2017ImpactTissue}; 5\% of hydrogen atoms in fatty acid chains of new lipids derived from water \cite{Turner2003MeasurementMIDA}.}}
    \label{fig:Lip:Load}
\end{figure}

The second study involved measuring $^2$H signals from the calf and abdomen in three different healthy male participants who underwent 28-days of drinking a mixture of heavy and regular water (D$_2$O/H$_2$O: 70/30\%). Fig. \ref{fig:Lip:Load} shows the loading schedules that participants followed, plus estimates of the expected changes in water and fat signals over 120 days. During loading the most \ac{D$_2$O} that was ingested on a single day was 150 ml. This slowing down of initial ramping of $^2$H enrichment compared with the regime used in Chapter \ref{Chap:D2O} meant that side effects of the loading were reduced. No reports of dizziness or nausea were reported during initial loading. Using the equations described in Section \ref{Chap:Lip:Theory} we find that the $^2$H signal from water, increases to approximately 100$\times$\ac{NA} in the loading period and then decreases after loading ceases, halving in amplitude every $\sim$6 days (Fig. \ref{fig:Lip:Load}). The fat signal rises more slowly to a maximum of 1.3-1.4 $\times$\ac{NA} and then slowly decreases, as also shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Lip:Load}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figures/Lipid/Coil_Position.png}
    \caption{\textit{Example of the coil positioning for the surface coil used to obtain data from the abdomen. Vitamin/oil pills can be seen on the side of the coil which were used as anatomical landmarks.}}
    \label{fig:Lip:Coil_Photo}
\end{figure}

Scans were performed on the same 3T scanner equipped with different in-house built $^2$H surface coils (5 cm-diameter for calf; 12 cm for abdomen, more information about the \ac{RF} coils can be found in chapter \ref{Chap:Coils}). Measurements were made before loading, to characterise \ac{NA} signals, and then every $\sim$14 days during/after loading for a further 8 sessions. Anatomical landmarks were used to position the coils as far as possible over the same region for each scan (under the calf/adjacent to the right abdomen near the liver). An example of the coil positioning used for obtaining data from the abdomen can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:Lip:Coil_Photo}. Here, the distance from the top of the head to the coil and from the top of the head to the end of the table is measured to characterise the coil position. Before loading started and at the end of the loading period, subjects were scanned multiple times in a session with inter-scan repositioning to allow estimation of fractional signal variation due to positioning errors. A short \ac{TR} of 50 or 70 ms was used to maximise the \ac{SNR} of the signal from fat, based on the relaxation time measurements previously made at \ac{NA} (see Table. \ref{fig:Lip:R_Table}). A full list of scan parameters can be found in Table \ref{fig:Lip:Scan_Detail}. Some of the scan parameters changed when a \ac{TR} of 70 ms was used, instead of a 50 ms \ac{TR}. 

%As reported in Table \ref{fig:Lip:Scan_Detail}, the calf/abdomen scanning sessions included acquisitions of a $^1$H scout scan; a $^1$H 3D gradient echo (\ac{GE}, \ac{FOV} = 128 $\times$ 128 $\times$ 192 / 446 $\times$ 446 $\times$ 250 mm$^3$, 2 mm isotropic voxels, \ac{TE} =  2.1/1.6 ms, TR: 20 ms, T$_\text{scan}$ = 122/88 s); bulk $^2$H spectra (\ac{FOV} = 300 $\times$ 300 $\times$ 12 mm$^3$, \ac{TR} = 50 ms, \ac{BW} = 2000 Hz, \ac{TE} = 0.37 ms, samples = 64, NSA = 256, T$_\text{scan}$ = 13 s); 1D $^2$H \ac{CSI} (\ac{FOV} = 300 $\times$ 300 $\times$ 150/300 $\times$ 300 $\times$ 140 mm$^3$, voxel size = 300 $\times$ 300 $\times$ 15/300 $\times$ 300 $\times$ 20 mm$^3$, \ac{TR} = 50 ms, \ac{BW} = 2000, \ac{TE} = 1.8/1.7 ms, samples = 64, NSA = 1024, T$_\text{scan}$ = 136/91 s) and 3D $^2$H \ac{CSI} (\ac{FOV} = 150 $\times$ 150 $\times$ 200 / 140 $\times$ 140 $\times$ 200 mm$^3$, voxel size = 15 $\times$ 15 $\times$ 20/20 $\times$ 20 $\times$ 20 mm$^3$, TR = 50 ms, \ac{BW} = 2000 Hz, \ac{TE} = 1.7 ms, samples = 64, NSA = 36/48, T$_\text{scan}$ = 520/420 s).

\end{table}

Code written in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, USA) using the OXSA-AMARES \cite{Purvis2017OXSA:MATLAB} toolbox was used to fit the signal from each voxel to a model incorporating water and fat peaks; in the calf, the water signal was modelled as a doublet with equal amplitudes (due to quadrupolar splitting) \cite{Gursan2022ResidualMuscle}. \ac{HOSVD} \cite{Bader2007EfficientTensors} with a core matrix of [16 5 5 5] was applied to the 4D data to improve \ac{SNR}. Water peaks were fitted with a chemical shift $\sim$4.8 ppm with a lipid peak at $\sim$1.3 ppm. Both sets of peaks shared the same phase in fitting. To produce single measures of signal enhancement with reduced sensitivity to \ac{FOV}-positioning, we averaged fat and water signal amplitudes over \ac{ROI}s (3 $\times$ 3 $\times$ 3/3 $\times$ 5 $\times$ 3 voxels covering 45 $\times$ 45 $\times$ 60 / 60 $\times$ 100 $\times$ 60 mm$^3$ for the calf/abdomen) positioned relative to the voxel with maximum water signal (i.e., over the centre of the surface coil) to obtain a water value, and shifted 1 voxel closer to subcutaneous fat (right for abdomen, posterior for calf) to obtain a lipid value, as shown in Figs. \ref{fig:Lip:Calf} and \ref{fig:Lip:Abdomen}.

Superficial fat signals are also evident post-loading (Figs. \ref{fig:Lip:Calf} and \ref{fig:Lip:Abdomen} C,D), but during loading are swamped by the $\sim$100$\times$ larger water signal (Figs. \ref{fig:Lip:Calf} and \ref{fig:Lip:Abdomen}B) making them indistinguishable in appearance and in fitting. A robust and reliable fit to the fat signal could only be achieved at times $>$50 days when the water signal had decreased to $<$10$\times$\ac{NA} (indicated by significantly elevated Cramer-Rao lower bound values at t$<$50 days).

Figures \ref{fig:Lip:1DCSI} and \ref{fig:Lip:3DCSI} show the temporal variation of the \ac{ROI}-averaged fat and water signals in calf and abdomen, respectively. As predicted from simulations (Fig. \ref{fig:Lip:Load}B) an increase in water signal to nearly $\times$100 \ac{NA} is evident, with a lower enhancement in Subject 3 who loaded less (Fig. \ref{fig:Lip:Load}A). Although the fat signal shows significant early enhancement (t $<$ 50 days) this tracks the water enhancement and is likely due to poor spectral fitting. Based on the predicted long-term elevation of fat signal (Fig. \ref{fig:Lip:Load}C), we focused on the average fat signal enhancement at times $>$ 50 days where fitting was robust (Fig. \ref{fig:Lip:Amp_Table}).

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Comparing other Relaxation Times}

From our measurements of the lipid signal’s 3.55 ppm chemical shift relative to water, it most likely originates predominantly from deuterium in methylene groups (-CH$_2$-) of fatty acids, consistent with signals observed previously in proton \ac{MRS} \cite{Ren2008CompositionTesla} and in agreement with most previous \textit{in vivo} $^2$H measurements \cite{Brereton1989TheMice}. In studies that administered D$_2$O to normal, obese, and diabetic mice, a peak from the deuterated water and a second peak assumed to be CHD groups from adipose tissues were observed \cite{Brereton1986PreliminarySpectroscopy, Brereton1989TheMice}, and the position of the CHD peak was in the approximate range of chemical shifts of 3.4 $\pm$ 0.4 ppm lower than the water resonance. Similarly, experiments on rats produced a lipid signal at approximately 3.4 ppm below the water peak \cite{Kosenkov2018TheMice}. In contrast, during experiments on the hind limbs of mice with tumour xenografts \cite{Assmann2020InCholesterol}, an \ac{HDO} peak was observed along with a second peak at 2.8 ppm below the water position. It was suggested \cite{Assmann2020InCholesterol} that this peak arose from cholesterol (or esters of), which may be actively synthesised in many tumour cells.

Previous deuterium T$_1$ measurements in muscle water produced values of 130 $\pm$ 7 ms (mouse, 9.2 MHz, 25$^\circ$C) and 160 $\pm$ 2.4 ms (rat, 13.7 MHz, \textit{ex vivo}) \cite{Block1987COMMUNICATIONSTissues}. Our measured values are higher, possibly due to the higher \textit{in vivo} temperature. A previous measurement of the ``CHD group" found T$_1$: 34 $\pm$ 4 ms (mouse abdomen, 30.7 MHz, in vivo) \cite{Brereton1986PreliminarySpectroscopy}, which is smaller than the value measured here. Our longer value could be a consequence of reduced accuracy caused by incomplete inversion of the lipid magnetization because of its short relaxation time \cite{Pfaff2017PredictingPulses}.

\subsection{Fat Changes}

% The T$_1$ times of \ac{HDO} \textit{in vivo} that we have measured are larger than those measured previously in mice \cite{Fung1979StudyWater} (9.2 MHz) and rats \cite{Block1987COMMUNICATIONSTissues} (13.7 MHz). However, the fat/lipid T$_1$ that has been previously measured \textit{in vivo} in mice (30.7 MHz) is at a larger field strength and gave a smaller T$_1$ 34 $\pm$ 4 ms \cite{Brereton1986PreliminarySpectroscopy}, this could be due to reduced accuracy because of a full inversion not being achieved for lipids. 

Previous research in animal models indicated that increases in fat are still observable $\sim$20 days after loading cessation, although substantial changes in the fat signal occur prior to this point \cite{Brereton1986PreliminarySpectroscopy}, which is supported by this work. Therefore, during our measuring period of $>$ 50 days fat signal should still be increased. Fat signal was increased relative to \ac{NA} in 5 of the 6 measurements and the increase reached statistical significance (P$<$0.05) in three measurements (Fig. \ref{fig:Lip:Amp_Table}). These results provide encouraging evidence that $^2$H MR can be used to detect the increased deuteration of subcutaneous fat resulting from lipid turn-over during long-term heavy water loading. 

The wider linewidths of the \ac{HDO} signals in the calf compared to the liver are due to quadrupolar splitting induced by anisotropic order in the muscle \cite{Gursan2022ResidualMuscle}, while motion averaging in the liver tissue mitigates this effect. This disparity makes detecting fat changes in the calf more challenging, as the fat peak is more likely to be contaminated by the broader peak from the large \ac{HDO} signal. The main experimental challenges were in quantifying fat signals in the presence of large water signals and in reproducibly positioning the surface RF coils in repeated experiments. To optimize lipid signal detection in the calf, a smaller coil was used, which is more sensitive to subcutaneous fat, while a 12 cm coil was employed in the abdomen. 

\subsection{Potential Improvements}

Previous research has demonstrated the feasibility of using inversion recovery sequences to null the HDO signal which leads to more reliable measures of changes in the fat signal \cite{Brereton1989TheMice}, especially when a dominant \ac{HDO} signal is still present. If the \ac{HDO} peak was nulled well enough consistently, spectroscopy would not be needed and imaging sequences tuned to the $^2$H resonance of lipid could be implemented. This could potentially result in higher \ac{SNR} or higher resolution. This can also be achieved post-processing through a similar technique that has been used to de-noise \ac{MRSI} data, Hankel Lanczos singular value decomposition. This technique is similar to \ac{HOSVD} except now the single values that contribute the most are removed, which reduces SNR. However, this approach can remove overlapping water peaks and has been commonly used in $^1$H spectroscopy \cite{Jansen20061HMetabolites, Cabanes2001OptimizationBrain}.

In future work, higher field could be used to provide better spectral separation of fat and water signals and 3D-printed, individualised coil holders would allow more reproducible coil positioning. This study utilized lower levels of $^2$H loading compared to previous research (2\% abundance of $^2$H compared to 10\%). Studies focused on body composition employ a similar level of heavy water loading to what was used in this study. The results of a similar study could also be combined with better $^1$H measurements to exclude any change in fat signal amplitude over the experimental time period. 

By making all the above improvements it could be possible to detect visceral lipids as well as obtain earlier time-points which would mean functional/kinetic modelling could be employed to distinguish different cohorts of participants. Cohorts could include insulin resistant individuals \cite{White2017AssociationHumans} and between races \cite{White2018RacialHumans} which have already been investigated using the invasive \ac{D$_2$O} loading methodology. These studies would allow comparisons to be made for using \textit{in vivo} \ac{MRI}/\ac{MRS} methodology vs invasive biopsy methodology and hopefully therefore provide this new methodology with efficacy.

\section{Conclusion}

Water (\ac{HDO}) and lipids (probably triglycerides) were identified in the \textit{in vivo} spectra from the human calf. T$_1$ and T$_2^*$ relaxation times were also measured and were consistent with literature values. Despite poor signal-to-noise ratio at \ac{NA} and the use of a surface coil for transceive, it was shown that such measurements are possible in a reasonable time period (approximately 30 minutes), suggesting that tracer-based metabolic studies of, e.g., triglyceride synthesis and turnover are possible in humans, and in such experimental conditions.  

This study marks the first instance of heavy water loading being employed to track lipid signals in human participants \textit{in vivo} using \ac{MRI}/\ac{MRS} as well as without the need for biopsy. While it has been demonstrated that measuring and fitting fat peaks following \ac{D$_2$O} loading in humans is possible, further refinement of \ac{HDO} signal suppression would enhance accuracy in tracking these signals. Refinement could include higher field strength, improved coil positioning and implementation of water suppression.
